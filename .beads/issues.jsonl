{"id":"open-saas-kit-bbr","title":"Switch toast from React Aria UNSTABLE_Toast to Sonner","design":"# Switch Toast to Sonner\n\n## Current State\n- Custom React Aria toast using `UNSTABLE_Toast` API (~350 lines)\n- Located at `packages/ui/src/components/ui/toast/toast.tsx`\n- Sonner v2.0.7 already installed but unused\n\n## Target State\n- Simple Sonner wrapper (~30 lines) matching taki-ui pattern\n- Same external API: `toast.success()`, `toast.error()`, etc.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1. Create Sonner wrapper\n```tsx\n// packages/ui/src/components/ui/sonner/sonner.tsx\n'use client';\n\nimport { useTheme } from 'next-themes'; // or custom theme hook\nimport { Toaster as SonnerToaster, toast } from 'sonner';\nimport type { ToasterProps } from 'sonner';\n\nfunction Toaster(props: ToasterProps) {\n  const { theme = 'system' } = useTheme?.() ?? {};\n\n  return (\n    \u003cSonnerToaster\n      className=\"toaster group\"\n      theme={theme as ToasterProps['theme']}\n      toastOptions={{\n        classNames: {\n          actionButton: 'group-[.toast]:bg-primary group-[.toast]:text-primary-foreground',\n          cancelButton: 'group-[.toast]:bg-muted group-[.toast]:text-muted-foreground',\n          description: 'group-[.toast]:text-muted-foreground',\n          toast: 'group toast group-[.toaster]:bg-background group-[.toaster]:text-foreground group-[.toaster]:border-border group-[.toaster]:shadow-lg',\n        },\n      }}\n      {...props}\n    /\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nexport { Toaster, toast };\n```\n\n### 2. Update exports\n- Create `packages/ui/src/components/ui/sonner/index.ts`\n- Update `packages/ui/src/index.ts` to export from sonner instead of toast\n- Keep backward-compatible exports if needed\n\n### 3. Update/Remove old toast\n- Delete or archive `packages/ui/src/components/ui/toast/toast.tsx`\n- Update stories to use Sonner API\n\n### 4. Update stories\n```tsx\n// sonner.stories.tsx\nimport { toast, Toaster } from './sonner';\n\n// API is similar:\ntoast.success('Saved!');\ntoast.error('Failed');\ntoast('Message', { description: 'Details' });\ntoast('With action', {\n  action: { label: 'Undo', onClick: () =\u003e {} },\n});\n```\n\n## API Comparison\n\n| Feature | Current | Sonner |\n|---------|---------|--------|\n| Basic | `toast('msg')` | `toast('msg')` |\n| Success | `toast.success('msg')` | `toast.success('msg')` |\n| Error | `toast.error('msg')` | `toast.error('msg')` |\n| Loading | `toast.loading('msg')` | `toast.loading('msg')` |\n| Promise | `toast.promise(p, {...})` | `toast.promise(p, {...})` |\n| Dismiss | `toast.dismiss(id)` | `toast.dismiss(id)` |\n| With desc | `toast({ title, description })` | `toast('title', { description })` |\n| With action | `toast({ title, action: {...} })` | `toast('title', { action: {...} })` |\n\n## Breaking Changes\n- `toast({ title: 'x', description: 'y' })` → `toast('x', { description: 'y' })`\n- Action format stays same\n\n## Files to Modify\n1. Create: `packages/ui/src/components/ui/sonner/sonner.tsx`\n2. Create: `packages/ui/src/components/ui/sonner/index.ts`\n3. Delete: `packages/ui/src/components/ui/toast/` directory\n4.

{"id":"open-saas-kit-qd3.1","title":"Configure RAC providers (Router, I18n) and locale optimization","description":"Set up react-aria-components integration with TanStack Router, i18n, and optimize locale bundle.\n\n## 1. RouterProvider Setup\n\nAdd RAC RouterProvider to __root.tsx to enable client-side navigation for RAC Link components:\n\n```tsx\n// src/routes/__root.tsx\nimport {RouterProvider} from 'react-aria-components';\nimport {I18nProvider} from 'react-aria-components';\nimport {useRouter, type NavigateOptions, type ToOptions} from '@tanstack/react-router';\n\n// Configure href and routerOptions types for all RAC components\ndeclare module 'react-aria-components' {\n  interface RouterConfig {\n    href: ToOptions,\n    routerOptions: Omit\u003cNavigateOptions, keyof ToOptions\u003e\n  }\n}\n\nexport const Route = createRootRoute({\n  component: () =\u003e {\n    let router = useRouter();\n    return (\n      \u003cI18nProvider locale=\"en-US\"\u003e\n        \u003cRouterProvider \n          navigate={(href, opts) =\u003e router.navigate({...href, ...opts})}\n          useHref={href =\u003e router.buildLocation(href).href}\u003e\n          {/* App content */}\n        \u003c/RouterProvider\u003e\n      \u003c/I18nProvider\u003e\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## 2. I18nProvider\n\nWraps the app to provide locale context to all RAC components:\n- Sets the locale for date/time formatting, number formatting, etc.\n- All RAC components use `useLocale()` hook internally\n- Can be dynamic based on user preference or URL\n\n```tsx\nimport {I18nProvider} from 'react-aria-components';\n\n// Static locale\n\u003cI18nProvider locale=\"en-US\"\u003e\n\n// Or dynamic from user settings\n\u003cI18nProvider locale={userLocale}\u003e\n```\n\n## 3. Locale Bundle Optimization\n\nInstall and configure the locale optimization plugin to reduce bundle size:\n\n```bash\npnpm add @react-aria/optimize-locales-plugin\n```\n\n```ts\n// app.config.ts (TanStack Start uses Vinxi/Vite)\nimport optimizeLocales from '@react-aria/optimize-locales-plugin';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  vite: {\n    plugins: [\n      {\n        ...optimizeLocales.vite({\n          locales: ['en-US'] // Add more as needed: 'fr-FR', 'es-ES', etc.\n        }),\n        enforce: 'pre'\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Why This Matters\n- **RouterProvider**: RAC Link uses client-side navigation instead of full page reloads\n- **I18nProvider**: Sets locale for all RAC components (dates, numbers, RTL, etc.)\n- **Locale optimization**: Reduces bundle from 30+ languages to only what you need\n\n## References\n- https://react-aria.adobe.com/frameworks\n- https://react-aria.adobe.com/I18nProvider\n\nThis task should be done BEFORE the first migration task (gah).","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jbabin91@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T15:27:45.30006-06:00","created_by":"Jace Babin","updated_at":"2026-01-20T15:43:40.889066-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-20T15:43:40.889066-06:00","close_reason":"Configured RAC providers (RouterProvider, I18nProvider) and locale optimization plugin","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"open-saas-kit-qd3.1","depends_on_id":"open-saas-kit-qd3","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-20T15:27:45.3023-06:00","created_by":"Jace Babin"}]}
