React mounts with `ThemeSyncer`\n3. `useDarkMode()` returns `false` (default in vitest context)\n4. `setTheme('light')` overrides the `dark` class\n\n## Files Involved\n\n- `.storybook/preview.tsx` - ThemeSyncer component\n- `.storybook/vitest.setup.light.ts` - Sets light class\n- `.storybook/vitest.setup.dark.ts` - Sets dark class\n\n## Attempted Fix\n\nTried checking pre-existing class in ThemeSyncer before applying theme, but caused infinite render loop due to next-themes updating the class which re-triggered the effect.\n\n## Potential Solutions\n\n1. Make `useDarkMode()` respect vitest globals (`globals.theme`)\n2. Skip ThemeSyncer in vitest context (detect via `import.meta.vitest` or similar)\n3. Use a different approach to sync themes that doesn't conflict with vitest setup\n4. Set theme via next-themes storage key before React mounts\n\n## Impact\n\nBlocks proper testing of color contrast accessibility in both modes.

Update exports\n- Create `packages/ui/src/components/ui/sonner/index.ts`\n- Update `packages/ui/src/index.ts` to export from sonner instead of toast\n- Keep backward-compatible exports if needed\n\n### 3. Update/Remove old toast\n- Delete or archive `packages/ui/src/components/ui/toast/toast.tsx`\n- Update stories to use Sonner API\n\n### 4.

I18nProvider\n\nWraps the app to provide locale context to all RAC components:\n- Sets the locale for date/time formatting, number formatting, etc.\n- All RAC components use `useLocale()` hook internally\n- Can be dynamic based on user preference or URL\n\n```tsx\nimport {I18nProvider} from 'react-aria-components';\n\n// Static locale\n\u003cI18nProvider locale=\"en-US\"\u003e\n\n// Or dynamic from user settings\n\u003cI18nProvider locale={userLocale}\u003e\n```\n\n## 3. Locale Bundle Optimization\n\nInstall and configure the locale optimization plugin to reduce bundle size:\n\n```bash\npnpm add @react-aria/optimize-locales-plugin\n```\n\n```ts\n// app.config.ts (TanStack Start uses Vinxi/Vite)\nimport optimizeLocales from '@react-aria/optimize-locales-plugin';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  vite: {\n    plugins: [\n      {\n        ...optimizeLocales.vite({\n          locales: ['en-US'] // Add more as needed: 'fr-FR', 'es-ES', etc.\n        }),\n        enforce: 'pre'\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Why This Matters\n- **RouterProvider**: RAC Link uses client-side navigation instead of full page reloads\n- **I18nProvider**: Sets locale for all RAC components (dates, numbers, RTL, etc.)\n- **Locale optimization**: Reduces bundle from 30+ languages to only what you need\n\n## References\n- https://react-aria.adobe.com/frameworks\n- https://react-aria.adobe.com/I18nProvider\n\nThis task should be done BEFORE the first migration task (gah).","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jbabin91@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T15:27:45.30006-06:00","created_by":"Jace Babin","updated_at":"2026-01-20T15:43:40.889066-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-20T15:43:40.889066-06:00","close_reason":"Configured RAC providers (RouterProvider, I18nProvider) and locale optimization plugin","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"open-saas-kit-qd3.1","depends_on_id":"open-saas-kit-qd3","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-20T15:27:45.3023-06:00","created_by":"Jace Babin"}]}

All components using DateInput inherit this behavior.\n\n## Expected Behavior (taki-ui)\n- Input width should fit content naturally by default\n- Width expands based on label or description text\n- Explicit `fullWidth` prop to opt into full-width behavior\n\n## Solution\nAdd `fullWidth` prop to DateInput and propagate to all wrapper components.\n\n### 1. DateInput (base component)\n```tsx\nexport type DateInputProps = Omit\u003cAriaDateInputProps, 'children'\u003e \u0026 {\n  className?: string;\n  fullWidth?: boolean;  // Defaults to false\n};\n\nexport const dateInputStyles = tv({\n  base: [\n    'flex h-9 items-center rounded-md',  // Remove w-full from base\n    ...\n  ],\n  variants: {\n    fullWidth: {\n      true: 'w-full',\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### 2. Wrapper components (accept and forward prop)\n- TimeField\n- DateField  \n- DatePicker\n- DateRangePicker\n\nEach wrapper adds `fullWidth?: boolean` to its props and forwards to DateInput.\n\n## Usage After Fix\n```tsx\n\u003cTimeField /\u003e                    // Fits content (default, matches taki-ui)\n\u003cTimeField fullWidth /\u003e          // Fills container\n\u003cDateField fullWidth label=\"Date\" /\u003e\n\u003cDatePicker fullWidth /\u003e\n```\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `packages/ui/src/components/ui/date-field/date-field.tsx` - DateInput + DateField\n- `packages/ui/src/components/ui/time-field/time-field.tsx` - TimeField\n- `packages/ui/src/components/ui/date-picker/date-picker.tsx` - DatePicker\n- `packages/ui/src/components/ui/date-range-picker/date-range-picker.tsx` - DateRangePicker\n\n## Stories to Update\nRemove `w-64` wrapper divs and add stories demonstrating both modes.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"jbabin91@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-28T16:05:18.735224-06:00","created_by":"Jace Babin","updated_at":"2026-01-28T16:08:47.823037-06:00"}
