{"id":"open-saas-kit-qd3.1","title":"Configure RAC providers (Router, I18n) and locale optimization","description":"Set up react-aria-components integration with TanStack Router, i18n, and optimize locale bundle.\n\n## 1. RouterProvider Setup\n\nAdd RAC RouterProvider to __root.tsx to enable client-side navigation for RAC Link components:\n\n```tsx\n// src/routes/__root.tsx\nimport {RouterProvider} from 'react-aria-components';\nimport {I18nProvider} from 'react-aria-components';\nimport {useRouter, type NavigateOptions, type ToOptions} from '@tanstack/react-router';\n\n// Configure href and routerOptions types for all RAC components\ndeclare module 'react-aria-components' {\n  interface RouterConfig {\n    href: ToOptions,\n    routerOptions: Omit\u003cNavigateOptions, keyof ToOptions\u003e\n  }\n}\n\nexport const Route = createRootRoute({\n  component: () =\u003e {\n    let router = useRouter();\n    return (\n      \u003cI18nProvider locale=\"en-US\"\u003e\n        \u003cRouterProvider \n          navigate={(href, opts) =\u003e router.navigate({...href, ...opts})}\n          useHref={href =\u003e router.buildLocation(href).href}\u003e\n          {/* App content */}\n        \u003c/RouterProvider\u003e\n      \u003c/I18nProvider\u003e\n    );\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## 2. I18nProvider\n\nWraps the app to provide locale context to all RAC components:\n- Sets the locale for date/time formatting, number formatting, etc.\n- All RAC components use `useLocale()` hook internally\n- Can be dynamic based on user preference or URL\n\n```tsx\nimport {I18nProvider} from 'react-aria-components';\n\n// Static locale\n\u003cI18nProvider locale=\"en-US\"\u003e\n\n// Or dynamic from user settings\n\u003cI18nProvider locale={userLocale}\u003e\n```\n\n## 3. Locale Bundle Optimization\n\nInstall and configure the locale optimization plugin to reduce bundle size:\n\n```bash\npnpm add @react-aria/optimize-locales-plugin\n```\n\n```ts\n// app.config.ts (TanStack Start uses Vinxi/Vite)\nimport optimizeLocales from '@react-aria/optimize-locales-plugin';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  vite: {\n    plugins: [\n      {\n        ...optimizeLocales.vite({\n          locales: ['en-US'] // Add more as needed: 'fr-FR', 'es-ES', etc.\n        }),\n        enforce: 'pre'\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Why This Matters\n- **RouterProvider**: RAC Link uses client-side navigation instead of full page reloads\n- **I18nProvider**: Sets locale for all RAC components (dates, numbers, RTL, etc.)\n- **Locale optimization**: Reduces bundle from 30+ languages to only what you need\n\n## References\n- https://react-aria.adobe.com/frameworks\n- https://react-aria.adobe.com/I18nProvider\n\nThis task should be done BEFORE the first migration task (gah).","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jbabin91@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-20T15:27:45.30006-06:00","created_by":"Jace Babin","updated_at":"2026-01-20T15:43:40.889066-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-20T15:43:40.889066-06:00","close_reason":"Configured RAC providers (RouterProvider, I18nProvider) and locale optimization plugin","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"open-saas-kit-qd3.1","depends_on_id":"open-saas-kit-qd3","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-20T15:27:45.3023-06:00","created_by":"Jace Babin"}]}
